Files from our paper modeling ethanol oxidation over Rh(111) in the presence of electric fields and water.
Provided are input (INCAR, KPOINTS, OSZICAR, POSCAR) and output files (OSZICAR, CONTCAR, OUTCAR) from simulations in this work using the VASP program.
Files are organized into different directories based on the solvation method (method 1, method 2, or in vacuum). For each adsorbate the files are provided for different potentials.
OUTCAR files can be quite large so only select OUTCAR files are provided (at 1 V/Å, 0 V/Å, and -1 V/Å). The POTCAR files for each system can be found under the vacuum (no_field) directory.
