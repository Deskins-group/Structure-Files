These files are structures from our recent paper on TiO2/graphene interfaces.
“The interactions between TiO2 and graphene with surface inhomogeneity determined using density functional theory”, Bukowski B, Deskins NA, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 17, 29734, 2015 doi:10.1039/C5CP04073F

The files are for single sheets of graphene (6x6) with different surface structures (pristine, vacancy, epoxide, hydroxyl) and adsorbed TiO2 clusters.
The lattice vectors for these structures are as follows:   (14.82, 0.0, 0.0), (7.41, 12.834496, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0, 25.0).
